The Cancer Data Science team and others at the Broad Institute came out with an article in [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/ncomms/) today detailing a new method for normalizing and integrating multiple large RNAi screening datasets. It's called DEMETER2, named after the Roman goddess of the harvest.

DEMETER2 uses a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate gene dependency scores in cancer cells from measurements of multiple shRNAs. Like the original [DEMETER](https://depmap.org/rnai/), DEMETER2 accounts for the effects of "seed sequences" that align to multiple sites in the genome.
